In 2009, I received Bachelors degrees in math, physics and computer science from the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu). In 2010, I received my Masters degree in physics from the University of Waterloo and [Perimeter Institute](www.perimeterinstitute.ca)'s Perimeter Scholars International program.
