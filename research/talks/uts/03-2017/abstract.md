# Rejection and Particle Filtering for Hamiltonian Learning #

Many tasks in quantum information rely on accurate knowledge
of a system's Hamiltonian, including calibrating control,
characterizing devices, and verifying quantum simulators. In
this talk, we pose the problem of learning Hamiltonians as
an instance of parameter estimation. We then solve this problem
with Bayesian inference, and describe how rejection and particle
filtering provide efficient numerical algorithms for learning
Hamiltonians. Finally, we discuss how filtering can be combined with
quantum resources to verify quantum systems beyond the
reach of classical simulators.
