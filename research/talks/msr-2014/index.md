## Abstract ##

With the increasing scale and complexity of quantum information processing experiments,
new methods are required to characterize and control quantum devices,
and to verify the correct operation of those devices. In particular,
the costs of simulating quantum systems are often a limiting factor in characterizaton
tasks. In this talk, we show how to integrate quantum simulation resources into
sequential Monte Carlo, and how this can alleviate some scaling concerns that
arise in purely classical approaches. We demonstrate the practicality
of our semiquantum algorithm by showing robustness to errors introduced
by finite sampling, and by excluded terms in the trusted simulator.
Finally, we discuss how to use this robustness together with Lieb-Robinson
bounds in order to bootstrap, using smaller quantum resources to characterize
larger devices.
